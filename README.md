# My Sidebar Menu App

### Welcome to my small sidebar menu application
Lets get started:

To run the application type: 
```
$ npm start
```

To install the json-server first run the command (this will be done globally)
```
$ npm install -g json-server
```

To start the server go to database file location **(sidebar-nav-app\src\assets)** and run following command 
(This will open the server on port 4000)
```
$ json-server -p 4000 db.json
```


Have fun!
